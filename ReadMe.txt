Project 2

I have chosen the Buildings option for this project.

As for the requirements:

1.Automatically create a variety of buildings.I am generating 3 buildings out of the total of 6 footprints.

2.When your program is run, show at least three buildings side-by-side, with the differences between them due to the use of random numbers.You can see in play mode my three randomly generated buildings.

3.Have an entry box for the initial random seed for your buildings, so that a user can cause your program to create different buildings. In each of the 6 footprint generators, there is a box to enter random number. This number is the maximum height of the building and also randomizes the floors,windows, and other components. I have kept this seed as 20 for now.

4.Your buildings must exhibit a variety of footprints (chosen from at least six different footprints). The footprint variation must not simply be longer or shorter rectangles. At least four of the possible footprints must be concave. My footprint shapes are L, U, T, I, J and “+”. I satisfy the footprint criteria that at least four footprints are concave.

5.Your buildings must show variations in elevation profiles, and this must include the possibility of one part of a building being taller than another part. All my buildings show a difference in height between the building components and this is generated randomly.

6.There must be at least two different styles of doors and two different styles of windows for the facades of your buildings. See the notes below on façade geometry.I do have two types of doors and three types of windows (normal glass window, window will sill, French window for balconies)

7.Your buildings must demonstrate at least two different roof styles. These roof styles should join properly where different building segments cross (e.g. cross-hip or cross-gable).I have two different types of roofs.

8.The walls of your buildings must come in at least two colors or patterns. All of the generated buildings have two colors and different textures applied.

9.At least one visual element of your buildings should be created through the use of texture maps. I have applied textures to a few elements


Additional Requirements for Graduate Students:

1.Create overhangs such as carports or a roofed porch that is supported with pillars. I have created balconies and an overhang in the roof area of my buildings.

2.Have all windows and doors include 3D geometry such as a door knob, steps, a frame or a window sill.
Doors have a door knob. There are steps to enter all the buildings. I have three types of windows out of which all have frames and one type has a window sill. 

Extra Effort Components

1.Have included water towers placed randomly over buildings.

2.Have also included AC units placed randomly across different floors of my building.

3.One type of the three total types of window is a transparent outbulging window.
